            <h2>The History of Swimming</h2>
            <p>Swimming has ancient origins dating back to Antiquity, with Egyptian paintings
                 depicting this practice. In the 18th century, Britain witnessed the emergence
                  of modern competitive swimming, with the introduction of rules and competitions. 
                  The 19th century saw the evolution of swimming techniques, including the crawl. 
                  In the 20th century, swimming experienced increasing internationalization
                   and became a major sport at the Olympic Games. Today, it remains a prestigious
                 Olympic sport and a recreational activity accessible to a wide audience, 
                illustrating a remarkable evolution from survival skills to a global phenomenon.</p>

            <h2>My Experience in Swimming</h2> 
            <p>My experience in the field of swimming began at a very young age,
                I started this sport at the age of 4 and continued until I was 13. 
                This sport helped me both physically and mentally to develop. With my best friend, 
                we competed together, and although he was better than me, he became the champion 
                of Alsace.</p>

            <h2>Why I Stopped Swimming</h2> 
            <p>I stopped swimming due to several issues, with one of the main problems being my 
                schedule. As my timetable became increasingly hectic, the time to get home became
                 too tight for me to attend my training sessions. However, that wasn't the only 
                 factor. A year before my decision to stop, there was a change in the coaching staff,
                  and I didn't appreciate the new coach. Therefore, I decided to quit swimming.</p>
